# Wine_Viz
Visualization of wine from Wine Enthusiast ratings

**Main Goal**
Understand which styles of wine and which regions have higher ratings, prices, and value.
Value is defined, in this case, as a balance between a high rating and a low price. 
Currently, the information is exclusively descriptive statistics. The goal is to update soon with more as free time comes and goes. 
The audience for this project is consumers: essentially, it is designed to be a tool to help a consumer make a decision when buying a bottle of wine. 

**Data Source**
Data was obtained via a Kaggle Spreadsheet. Original file was too large to be uploaded
Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelmcguire/wine-reviews-data 

**Cleaning Data**
wine_personal1 python file is data in its original form that has been cleaned and transformed. 

**Data Visualization**
Wine_Viz.twb is the tableau workbook associated.

**Next Steps**
The ultimate goal is to utilize wine regions and create maps in Tableau. I would love to map different regions that can be displayed per country and shown via value. 
Additionally, I would like to perform text analysis to make recommendations based on reviews and user-selected tastes.
