# Wine_Viz
Visualization of wine from Wine Enthusiast ratings

Data was obtained via a Kaggle Spreadsheet. 
wine_personal1 python file is data in its original form that has been cleaned and transformed. 
Wine_Viz.twb is the tableau workbook assocaited. 

The ultimate goal is to utilize wine regions and create maps in tableau. Additionally, I would like to perform text analytics to make recommendations.
This is a side-project, so it's something that will have to happen in my spare time! If you have any questions, please reach out!
